          May Allah accept all your prayers, supplications and fasts in this
          great month of Ramadan. It has been a time for reflection for us as
          individuals, coming together as a community and remembering and
          supporting Muslims around the world. We pray that you have been able
          to maximise your good deeds in these last 30 days and can use these
          experiences to continue in the worship of Allah in the year ahead. The
          masjid community has been able to partake in Taraweeh prayers for
          brothers and sisters, regular Islamic lessons and Quran memorisation
          for children, daily iftar and weekly community iftar gatherings. These
          activities would not be possible without all of you. We appreciate the
          hard work and dedication of our management, staff and volunteers who
          have given up their free time to serve the community. This has
          included the work of Imams who led Taraweeh, our teachers, chefs and
          helpers who prepared iftar food and cleaners who kept the House of
          Allah tidy all month. May Allah reward you with Goodness for looking
          after His servants during the holy month. We wish you all a fantastic
          day with friends and families.
